        <p>In this course we will learn how to describe the relationships 
          between changing quantities using the tools of differential and 
          integral calculus. We will explore the ideas of continuity, limits, 
          differentiation, and integration in both theoretical and applied 
          contexts.

        <p>It is my experience that much of your learning in this course will occur outside of class.  You might get stuck on a homework problem or perhaps you have a question from class that did not get fully resolved.  For these reasons, it's important that you know how to get help outside of class.  Here are a few resources.

            <li> <title>Drop-In Student Hours</title> 
              <p>I have set aside the following specific times during the week that I am available for drop-in help. You do not need to let me know you're coming -- just stop by my office (BC 270). Many students find these drop-in hours can be particularly helpful if you are working together with classmates. You can work together at one of the tables down the hall from my office and just pop in when you have any questions.

              <p>I recognize that your schedule might not allow you to stop by during the posted drop-in hours.  Or you simply might find it more convenient to meet with me at a different time.  If you go to my Calendly scheduler <url href="https://calendly.com/hallstro">calendly.com/hallstro</url>, you can sign-up for a time slot to meet, either in person or via zoom.  If there is a specific time that works for you and you don't see it available on the Calendly scheduler, please reach out to me via email and we will find a time that works for your schedule.

            <li><title>Open Door</title> 
              <p>I have the scheduled drop-in hours simply to give you some times when you know that I'll be available -- but you are <em>always</em> welcome to stop by my office <em>at any time</em>.  Unless I'm in class or in a meeting, I will generally be available to meet with you.

              <p>The MRC offers both drop-in tutoring as well as individualized help.  I will post the MRC schedule on Moodle as soon as it becomes available (usually the second week of the semester).  You can also find information about the MRC (and other resources at the Learning Commons) at <url href="https://bit.ly/learning-up">https://bit.ly/learning-up</url>

        <p>
          The primary course website is <url href="https://learning.up.edu/moodle">Moodle</url>.
          On Moodle, you can expect to find:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Links to important resources, like this syllabus and the textbook.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Links to key course activities, including the online homework,
                and the discussion forum. (The links will log you into those services automatically.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          As you learn to navigate online learning (and as I learn how to guide you),
          the weekly topics schedules will be key to staying on top of your course material.
          Every week you can expect to receive details on readings, videos,
          homework, and assessments, as well as information on what will be taking place in class,
          and how to access those classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case there's a day when Moodle isn't working properly and you need access to course materials,
          you can find some of them (like this syllabus) on my <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/teaching.html">personal website</url>.
          The textbook for this course (and many others) is available on our <url href="https://opentext.uleth.ca">Open Textbook Server</url>.

          Math 1560 will be taught using a blend of synchronous and asynchronous instruction.
          Asynchronous components are explained in later sections.
          We have maintained the originally scheduled class meeting times,
          which are as follows:

        <p>
          You should try to attend your assigned section, or it'll mess up the group work dynamics.
          But that's not always realistic, so attend when you can. (I won't tell the Registrar if you don't.)
          Let me know if you want to change times permanently.
          And if group members are expecting you, let them know too!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also a weekly <em>tutorial</em>.
          Tutorials take place on Thursday and Friday.
          Since there are 11 tutorial sections, we won't list them all here.
          The easiest way to access your tutorial information is by looking up your personal schedule on <url href="https://bridge.uleth.ca/">the Bridge</url>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Classes will be a mixture of Q&amp;A (where I do examples by request)
          and group work (using Zoom's <term>breakout room</term> feature).
          Sometimes I will provide a problem for discussion that you will work on as a group,
          and then we'll reconvene as a class to compare group responses.
          You will also have time in class to work on group assignments,
          and after each test there will be a group test that takes place in class.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Q&amp;A portion:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                You can use the discussion forum to recommend problems for us to discuss.
                (See <xref ref="section-communication"/>. I'll run a live Q&amp;A session on Piazza.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Once we choose a question to solve, I'll give the class an opportunity for input on how to solve it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I will record my solution (based on your input) and upload later to YouTube.
                Recording will be done so that only my video is captured.
                (That is: if you all want to turn on your cameras so I can see your smiling/frowning faces,
                I promise not to record you and put it on YouTube.)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Tutorials will be synchronous, and facilitated by a tutorial instructor.
          You will use tutorials to work on the basic computational skills essential to success in calculus.
          Work in tutorial will be done in groups, and graded for feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can't attend tutorial synchronously, please let me know.
          I'll try to accommodate. This is the one part of the class where I think you'll be way better off if you can attend in person.

      <title>Course Content and Objectives</title>
      <p>
        This course is an introduction to differential and integral calculus with an emphasis on applications in the natural and physical sciences. It is aimed at mathematics, engineering, and science majors or anyone else interested in building a foundation for further study in mathematics. Course-level learning goals include: communicating effectively about course content and solution methods; per- sistence in solving challenging, multi-step problems; reflection on one?s own learning; effective use of technology. Certain affective traits (i.e., dispositions and habits that are useful for all learners, regardless of topic) are also valued, such as persistence and growth mindset, and the development of these qualities will be fostered by the course.

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-core">
  <title>University Core</title>
  <p>
    Calculus at the University of Portland is a part of our liberal arts 
    Core Curriculum with a vision of students acquiring knowledge, 
    skills, and values that will prepare you to respond to the needs of 
    the world and its human family, while having a foundation of 
    multiple lenses to address enduring questions of human concern. 
    The Core Curriculum strives to achieve this vision by 
    cultivating six habits of heart and mind in all graduates regardless 
    of major.
    </p>

    <p>
    As a priority for this Core class, our focus is the <q>scientific and 
    quantitative literacy and problem solving</q> habit. As part of 
    developing that habit this course will prioritize students learning 
    to employ mathematical and statistical skills to explore and make 
    sense of data. Toward this end, as one specific Core learning 
    outcome for this class, the expectation is that students who 
    complete this course will be able to use the tools of differential 
    calculus to solve complex problems and effectively communicate 
    solutions in written form.

<section xml:id="sec-assessment">
  <title>Methods of Assessment</title>
<p>This course is guided by the philosophy that learning mathematics requires focused effort, reflection, and revision. Assessment of this course is based on a proficiency system, in which students have multiple attempts to demonstrate proficiency, with opportunities to reflect on and improve previous understanding.</p>

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-participation">
        <title>Participation</title>
        <p>You are expected to actively participate in this classroom community. This can include coming to class on time, being prepared, being willing to ask questions and share ideas, setting up study groups outside of class, attending tutoring sessions, posting helpful resources online, and contributing to the classroom virtual chat. Exit cards will be assigned regularly at the conclusion of class as part of participation assessment. Group and individual presentations of ideas is a required component of participation.
        </p>
        <p>We will cover new course material on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Most Tuesday class times will be for small group work on labs and for proficiency assessment.
        </p>
      </subsection>

          
      <subsection xml:id="subsec-homework">
        <title>Homework</title>
        <p>Regular practice is required to convert new skills into lasting, automatic procedures. For most sections, you will be required to complete an online homework via WebWork. The online homework will be due at 5:00 pm. Homework is due Monday, Wednesday, or Friday the class period after it is covered in class. Homework is graded automatically. 
        </p>
        <p>It is strongly suggested that you do your homework regularly; it's best done following class, when it is fresh in your mind.  Most questions allow unlimited attempts and there is no penalty for incorrect answers. If you find yourself stuck on a problem after many attempts, please reach out for additional help! Late homework can earn up to half credit.

        <p>Semi-weekly labs will be due on Wednesdays at 5pm. Lab problems should be either typed or written and submitted as a pdf file in Moodle. These labs are part of the Core Assessment, and will have common grading across all MTH 201 sections. Labs will be graded on three components:
          <dl>
            <li><title>Validity:</title>
              <p>Is the method correct?  Is the final solution correct? 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><title>Explanation:</title>
              <p>Is the solution method well explained? Is the reasonableness of the solution justified?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><title>Representation:</title>
              <p>Is the solution process clearly written? Is the solution supported with appropriate graphs/diagrams/equations? Is mathematical notation used clearly and correctly?

        <title>Video Quizzes</title>
        <p>Before each class, you will complete a 5-question, multiple-choice video quiz embedded in Moodle. You have two attempts and your highest attempt is recorded. To prepare for the video quiz, a 20 minute video Intro video is assigned for each section. An optional video with additional examples is posted for most sections as well.

        <p>Periodically throughout the semester I will ask you to think about your process and assess your progress in the course.  Reflections are a place to consider how things are going (and communicate that to me).  Self-assessments are an opportunity for you to connect the skills and proficiencies that you're practicing with the course-level objectives, as well as make the case that your progress in the course warrants a particular grade.

<subsection xml:id="section-revisit">
<title>Revisting Your Work</title>
<p>Much of your work in this class can be revised.  Everyone's path to understanding is different but we all benefit from reflecting on our mistakes.  Since much of the mathematical content will build on previous ideas, however, reflecting in a timely way is important (hence a one-week deadline).
</p>
<p>In addition to the regular in-class quizzes, you may re-assess any of the Learning Targets that we've covered through any either of the following methods:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On quiz days there is additional time to retake additional Learning Target quizzes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may schedule a retake on a particular Learning Target to be done during Help Hours in my office. This retake can be arranged to be done via conversation rather than written form.
    </p>
  </li>
<li><p>The final exam will be used for additional Learning Target retakes. University policy requires that students take the final exam at the time determined by the registrar.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>There are some restrictions on re-assessing using these methods:
  <ul>
    <li><p>Reassessments must be completed within 4 weeks of the first scheduled assessment.</p></li>
    <li><p>A reassessment application must be submitted via email at least 24 hours in advance of the reassessment time.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Reassessment applications must include the name of the learning target and a copy of written corrections from the previous quiz.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>You may not do more than one re-assessment per learning target outside of class per week.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

<subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-oralexam">
  <title>Oral Exams</title>

    <section xml:id="sec-technology">
      <title>Technology elements</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          To facilitate online teaching,
          our course will rely on several technological solutions.
          This section provides details on navigating the technology.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <subsection xml:id="subsec-webwork">
        <title>Online homework</title>
        <p>
          Online homework is delivered via WeBWorK.
          WeBWorK is an open source homework system that I maintain on a local server.
          This service is provided to you free of charge, and your data never leaves campus.
          <fn>Okay, this is not entirely true. Since faculty are expected to teach from home,
          your data does travel from campus to my house via the university VPN.</fn>
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of WeBWorK is that questions are automatically graded,
          providing you with immediate feedback on your work.
          This is an excellent source of guided practice.
        </p>
        <video youtube="79kRzUV7f2U" xml:id="video-webwork"/>
        <p>
          <em>To access WeBWorK</em>: simply click the relevant link in Moodle.
          You will be signed in automatically <mdash/> there is no user name or password.
          But keep in mind that if your session times out due to inactivity,
          you have to return to Moodle to log in again.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Submitting answers</em>: WeBWorK has an automatic preview feature.
          The mathematics in your answer will be rendered as you type.
          (You can turn this off in the user settings if you don't like it.)
          If everything looks good, click the Submit button.
          The system will immediately respond with <q>Correct</q> or <q>Incorrect</q>.
          If your answer is correct, there is nothing more to do: your answer has been recorded,
          and you have credit for that problem.
          If your answer is incorrect, you get to try again.
          (<em>Exception</em>: I typically do not give unlimited attempts for true/false and multiple choice questions.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Other notes</em>:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Some questions are <q>scaffolded</q> <mdash /> there are multiple parts,
                and you need to complete one part before being allowed to access the next.
                For these, you want to click the Preview Answers button, rather than Submit,
                to check your work and move on to the next step.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you need to include scientific units in an answer,
                the automatic equation rendering can cause trouble.
                There's a little tool bar on the right hand side that lets you switch to <em>text mode</em> to enter units.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                At the bottom of each page is an <q>Email Instructor</q> button.
                If you are stuck on a problem, or if you think there is an error in the programming (it happens!)
                you can use this to let me know.
                WeBWorK will send me an email with your message,
                along with a link to the exact version of the problem you were working on.
                Often I can figure out where you're going wrong by looking at your answer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please <em>do not</em> use the email button to ask me how to solve a problem.
                That's what the discussion forum is for.
                It should only be used afer you've made several attempts at the problem,
                or if you see an error message of some sort.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, some general advice: WeBWorK is not a new addition for the online environment.
          I've used it for awhile. The students who do well in this course are the ones who start their problem sets early.
          Please do not wait until the due date to begin: it leaves you no time to ask questions!
          The most effective way to use WeBWorK is to read the relevant portion of the textbook,
          try the problems, and then ask for help on the ones you're stuck on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, and please do not wait until you've made 50 unsuccessful attempts at a problem to ask for help.
          If you haven't figured out a question after 5 or 6 attempts, set it aside, and come back to it a bit later.
          If you still can't figure it out, go the discussion forum.

          Tests and assignments will be submitted through Crowdmark.
          Like WeBWorK, Crowdmark is connected to Moodle,
          so you just have to click a link in Moodle to access your assessement and submit your work.

          I may choose to record some parts of our classes on Zoom.
          Any time I record, you will receive a warning (in case you want to turn off your camera, perhaps).
          Note that Zoom does not record breakout rooms.
          Typically, I will only record when I am presenting the solution to a problem.

                This will let you ask more detailed questions than the Zoom chat.

            During most Zoom sessions, you will be put into smaller breakout rooms to work on problems.
            Breakout rooms are not recorded, and I cannot actively monitor the breakout rooms <mdash />
            these are essentially private working sessions for your group.
            I <em>do</em> have the ability to join a breakout room temporarily,
            but will only do so when invited.
            If you need my help during a breakout session, there is an <q>Ask for help</q> button you can use to get my attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be encouraged to use Microsoft OneNote to collaborate with your group.
            OneNote lets you type notes, insert photos, and use handwriting, if you have a touch-enabled device.
            Unlike the Zoom chat and whiteboard features,
            your OneNote notebook will remain available after class for you to refer to.
            See <xref ref="subsec-onenote"/> for more details.

            First of all: I do not intend to record entire Zoom meetings.
            I will record myself if I'm doing an example or solving a problem someone has requested,
            and post those recordings online for later reference.
            I have things set up so that I only record myself, with recording anyone else.
            This should let us avoid any privacy concerns.

          <p>
            Please be aware that it is an <alert>academic offence</alert> to record a class,
            or anyone in it, without prior authorization.
            If all members of a breakout room agree to having someone record your discussion,
            this is fine. When are in the <q>main room</q> of Zoom, recording is not permitted.

          OneNote will be used both for class presentations,
          and for student collaboration.
          Details here will include how to access class notebooks,
          how to edit collaboratively, how to print, <etc />.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students will have access to OneNote through their Office 365 accounts.
          There were early promises of Moodle integration that don't seem to have worked out.
          What we got instead are class <q>teams</q> on Microsoft Teams.
          There's one team per section, and each team has a class notebook attached to it.

        This section deals with questions about accommodations, missed tests,
        and other exceptional (yet common) cases.

            <title>I don't think I can attend the classes regularly. Can I still take the course?</title>
            <p>
              Short answer: yes. I recognize that not all students have access to the same technology.
              If your home internet is unreliable, attending Zoom sessions could be a challenge.
              If you can't attend synchronous sessions, I will arrange alternatives for graded work done asynchronously.
              I will also try to connect you with other students in the same situation,
              so that you still have a group you can work with.

            <title>What happens if I get sick?</title>
            <p>
              I'll do my best to be accommodating of any illness that interrupts your studies.
              There is no need to provide details of the illness.
              If you miss a week or more of work, please get in touch to make a plan for catching up.
              One of the biggest challenges in math is that once you fall behind,
              it's difficult to catch up on your own.

          </li>
          <li>
            <title>What exactly does academic honesty mean?</title>
            <p>
              In short, that any work you represent as your own, is your own.
              Much of your work can be done in groups, but not all of it.
              I will assume that you have access to a calculator,
              including online tools (like <url href="https://www.symbolab.com/">Symbolab</url>)
              that give you step-by-step solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use of these tools is acceptable, but take care that you are not overly reliant on them.
              What is not acceptable is having someone else do your work for you.
              This includes tutors, classmates, friends, family members, and online <q>homework help</q> sites.
              If you are paying money in exchange for answers to graded work,
              you are committing an academic offence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Penalties for academic dishonesty are outlined in the
              <url href="https://www.uleth.ca/policy/resources/student-discipline-policy-academic-offences-undergraduate-students">Academic Calendar</url>.
              Depending on the severity of the offence, penalties for a first offence can range from a grade of zero on an assessment,
              to an F in the courses.
              Academic offences are also reported to the Dean of Arts &amp; Sciences.
              They keep a record of each offence, and students with multiple offences can be subject to supplementary discipline.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Does that mean I'm not allowed to get help with my homework?</title>
            <p>
              Not at all! But keep in mind that your course instructors will be available for help,
              free of charge. (OK, maybe not free of charge, but you've already paid for it with your tuition.)
              We will be responding on the discussion forum regularly,
              There will be time to ask questions in every class, and there will be online office hours.
              The Student Success Centre will also be running free help sessions (details TBA).
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of you may still decide to pay for tutoring, and that's fine.
              But you have a duty to disclose sources of help on an assignment,
              and the individual tests are still tests, even if you won't have someone watching over your shoulder.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should probably avoid the various paid <q>homework help</q> websites.
              Most of these don't offer help. They offer worked solutions for a price.
              Getting those solutions won't help with your understanding.
              More importantly, the people working for these sites are paid (poorly) per solution,
              and they often provide incorrect and/or badly written work.
              (We saw plenty of examples of this last Spring, and yes, all those students now have discipline reports on file.)

          <li>
            <title>I missed a test! What do I do? Do I get a zero?</title>
            <p>
              First, contact me as soon as possible for any missed test.
              There are <em>five</em> tests, and I only count <em>four</em> towards your grade.
              As long as you only miss one test, there is no penalty.
              This is true regardless of your reason for missing the test.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>What if I really wanted to write that test?</title>
            <p>
              Inform me of this when you contact me to explain your absence.
              There's no guarantee that I can schedule a makeup test, but I'll try.
              You're more likely to get a makeup test if you've contacted me in advance.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Do I need a doctor's note?</title>
            <p>
              No. This wastes health care resources and your time.
              (That was my answer before the pandemic, and it's doubly so now.)
              Just email me to say you were sick.
              However, if you miss more than one test due to illness,
              we'll need to meet to discuss how to adjust your grade.

            <title>I receive learning accommodations. What arrangements can I make?</title>
            <p>
              First, make sure that you have registered with the University's
              <url href="https://www.uleth.ca/ross/accommodated-learning-centre">Accommodated Learning Centre</url>.
              No need to let me know: they notify me of every student with accommodations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some accommodations will look a bit different this year,
              but exam accommodations such as extra time are still possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              If there are any adjustments I can make
              to facilitate your learning, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me.
              All students deserve an equal opportunity to learn.
              Note that the <init>HTML</init> textbook is designed with accessibility in mind,
              and should work with screen readers.
              However, I regret that we have not had the time (or paid help) necessary to add elements such as alt-text descriptions for images.
              It's on the to-do list, but that list is long, and growing.

              Send me an email. Extensions are usually granted as long as they're granted ahead of time.
              Online homework extensions need to be in place before solutions become available.
              Book an appointment with me as soon as you feel like you're falling behind and I'll do my best to get you up to speed.

          I will attempt to follow the schedule below,
          bearing in mind that some adjustments are always needed,
          and this is probably more likely as we attempt to navigate an online environment.
          Numbers below refer to textbook sections.

        <p>
          Every class will have some time for Q&amp;A, and for discussion.
          Wednesday classes will have time dedicated to group work.
          Depending on the week, this group work could be the group portion of a test,
          or time to work on one of the assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Online homework assignments will be due Mondays.
          This is because tests will run on Tuesdays,
          and you are better off on a test if you've done your homework ahead of time.

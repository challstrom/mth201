        <p>In this course we will learn how to describe the relationships 
          between changing quantities using the tools of differential and 
          integral calculus. We will explore the ideas of continuity, limits, 
          differentiation, and integration in both theoretical and applied 
          contexts.

        <p>In our classroom, diversity and individual differences are respected, appreciated, and recognized as a source of strength. I support the use of mathematics as an analytic tool to challenge power, privilege, and oppression. It is our collective responsibility to create a welcoming space where ideas can be challenged while individuals are respected. I ask you to support one another as you develop as mathematicians and analytic thinkers.

        <p>It is my experience that much of your learning in this course will occur outside of class.  You might get stuck on a homework problem or perhaps you have a question from class that did not get fully resolved.  For these reasons, it's important that you know how to get help outside of class.  Here are a few resources.

            <li> <title>Drop-In Student Hours</title> 
              <p>I have set aside the following specific times during the week that I am available for drop-in help. You do not need to let me know you're coming -- just stop by my office (BC 270). Many students find these drop-in hours can be particularly helpful if you are working together with classmates. You can work together at one of the tables down the hall from my office and just pop in when you have any questions.

              <p>I recognize that your schedule might not allow you to stop by during the posted drop-in hours.  Or you simply might find it more convenient to meet with me at a different time.  If you go to my Calendly scheduler <url href="https://calendly.com/hallstro">calendly.com/hallstro</url>, you can sign-up for a time slot to meet, either in person or via zoom.  If there is a specific time that works for you and you don't see it available on the Calendly scheduler, please reach out to me via email and we will find a time that works for your schedule.

              <p>I have the scheduled drop-in hours simply to give you some times when you know that I'll be available -- but you are <em>always</em> welcome to stop by my office <em>at any time</em>.  Unless I'm in class or in a meeting, I will generally be available to meet with you.

        <p>
          The primary course website is <url href="https://learning.up.edu/moodle">Moodle</url>.
          On Moodle, you can expect to find:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Links to important resources, like this syllabus and the textbook.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Links to key course activities, including the online homework,
                and the discussion forum. (The links will log you into those services automatically.)

        </p>
        <p>
          As you learn to navigate online learning (and as I learn how to guide you),
          the weekly topics schedules will be key to staying on top of your course material.
          Every week you can expect to receive details on readings, videos,
          homework, and assessments, as well as information on what will be taking place in class,
          and how to access those classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case there's a day when Moodle isn't working properly and you need access to course materials,
          you can find some of them (like this syllabus) on my <url href="http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat/teaching.html">personal website</url>.

          Math 1560 will be taught using a blend of synchronous and asynchronous instruction.
          Asynchronous components are explained in later sections.
          We have maintained the originally scheduled class meeting times,
          which are as follows:

        <p>
          You should try to attend your assigned section, or it'll mess up the group work dynamics.
          But that's not always realistic, so attend when you can. (I won't tell the Registrar if you don't.)
          Let me know if you want to change times permanently.
          And if group members are expecting you, let them know too!
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also a weekly <em>tutorial</em>.
          Tutorials take place on Thursday and Friday.
          Since there are 11 tutorial sections, we won't list them all here.
          The easiest way to access your tutorial information is by looking up your personal schedule on <url href="https://bridge.uleth.ca/">the Bridge</url>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Classes will be a mixture of Q&amp;A (where I do examples by request)
          and group work (using Zoom's <term>breakout room</term> feature).
          Sometimes I will provide a problem for discussion that you will work on as a group,
          and then we'll reconvene as a class to compare group responses.
          You will also have time in class to work on group assignments,
          and after each test there will be a group test that takes place in class.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Q&amp;A portion:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                You can use the discussion forum to recommend problems for us to discuss.
                (See <xref ref="section-communication"/>. I'll run a live Q&amp;A session on Piazza.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Once we choose a question to solve, I'll give the class an opportunity for input on how to solve it.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I will record my solution (based on your input) and upload later to YouTube.
                Recording will be done so that only my video is captured.
                (That is: if you all want to turn on your cameras so I can see your smiling/frowning faces,
                I promise not to record you and put it on YouTube.)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Tutorials will be synchronous, and facilitated by a tutorial instructor.
          You will use tutorials to work on the basic computational skills essential to success in calculus.
          Work in tutorial will be done in groups, and graded for feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can't attend tutorial synchronously, please let me know.
          I'll try to accommodate. This is the one part of the class where I think you'll be way better off if you can attend in person.

      <title>Course Content and Objectives</title>
      <p>
        This course is an introduction to differential and integral calculus with an emphasis on applications in the natural and physical sciences. It is aimed at mathematics, engineering, and science majors or anyone else interested in building a foundation for further study in mathematics. Course-level learning goals include: communicating effectively about course content and solution methods; per- sistence in solving challenging, multi-step problems; reflection on one?s own learning; effective use of technology. Certain affective traits (i.e., dispositions and habits that are useful for all learners, regardless of topic) are also valued, such as persistence and growth mindset, and the development of these qualities will be fostered by the course.

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-core">
  <title>University Core</title>
  <p>
    Calculus at the University of Portland is a part of our liberal arts 
    Core Curriculum with a vision of students acquiring knowledge, 
    skills, and values that will prepare you to respond to the needs of 
    the world and its human family, while having a foundation of 
    multiple lenses to address enduring questions of human concern. 
    The Core Curriculum strives to achieve this vision by 
    cultivating six habits of heart and mind in all graduates regardless 
    of major.
    </p>

    <p>
    As a priority for this Core class, our focus is the <q>scientific and 
    quantitative literacy and problem solving</q> habit. As part of 
    developing that habit this course will prioritize students learning 
    to employ mathematical and statistical skills to explore and make 
    sense of data. Toward this end, as one specific Core learning 
    outcome for this class, the expectation is that students who 
    complete this course will be able to use the tools of differential 
    calculus to solve complex problems and effectively communicate 
    solutions in written form.

<section xml:id="sec-assessment">
  <title>Methods of Assessment</title>
<p>This course is guided by the philosophy that learning mathematics requires focused effort, reflection, and revision. Assessment of this course is based on a proficiency system, in which students have multiple attempts to demonstrate proficiency, with opportunities to reflect on and improve previous understanding.</p>

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-participation">
        <title>Participation</title>
        <p>You are expected to actively participate in this classroom community. This can include coming to class on time, being prepared, being willing to ask questions and share ideas, setting up study groups outside of class, attending tutoring sessions, posting helpful resources online, and contributing to the classroom virtual chat. Exit cards will be assigned regularly at the conclusion of class as part of participation assessment. Group and individual presentations of ideas is a required component of participation.
        </p>
        <p>We will cover new course material on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Most Tuesday class times will be for small group work on labs and for proficiency assessment.

      <subsection xml:id="subsec-homework">
        <title>Homework</title>
        <p>Regular practice is required to convert new skills into lasting, automatic procedures. For most sections, you will be required to complete an online homework via WebWork. The online homework will be due at 5:00 pm. Homework is due Monday, Wednesday, or Friday the class period after it is covered in class. Homework is graded automatically. 
        </p>
        <p>It is strongly suggested that you do your homework regularly; it's best done following class, when it is fresh in your mind.  Most questions allow unlimited attempts and there is no penalty for incorrect answers. If you find yourself stuck on a problem after many attempts, please reach out for additional help! Late homework can earn up to half credit.

<subsection xml:id="section-revisit">
<title>Revisting Your Work</title>
<p>Much of your work in this class can be revised.  Everyone's path to understanding is different but we all benefit from reflecting on our mistakes.  Since much of the mathematical content will build on previous ideas, however, reflecting in a timely way is important (hence a one-week deadline).
</p>
<p>In addition to the regular in-class quizzes, you may re-assess any of the Learning Targets that we've covered through any either of the following methods:
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On quiz days there is additional time to retake additional Learning Target quizzes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You may schedule a retake on a particular Learning Target to be done during Help Hours in my office. This retake can be arranged to be done via conversation rather than written form.
    </p>
  </li>
<li><p>The final exam will be used for additional Learning Target retakes. University policy requires that students take the final exam at the time determined by the registrar.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>There are some restrictions on re-assessing using these methods:
  <ul>
    <li><p>Reassessments must be completed within 4 weeks of the first scheduled assessment.</p></li>
    <li><p>A reassessment application must be submitted via email at least 24 hours in advance of the reassessment time.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Reassessment applications must include the name of the learning target and a copy of written corrections from the previous quiz.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>You may not do more than one re-assessment per learning target outside of class per week.</p>

       Consider Moodle your “base camp” for this course.  All information, assignments, updates, Zoom links, etc. will be posted there.

      <title>Classroom Climate</title>
      <p>
        As someone who works hard to facilitate an environment that is safe and productive and that fosters inclusivity and deep belonging for each and every person in the room, I ask that you be courteous and respectful.  I hope we can all learn to recognize individual differences as a source of strength and believe that each one of you is vital to the successful creation of a rich and diverse classroom space -- regardless of background, identity, or beliefs.  Moreover, I contend that all perspectives are valuable (even those that are unpopular or that cause discomfort) because they are precisely what help broaden our understanding of the world and the people in it.  As such, it is important that we approach one another with curiosity and kindness while trying to avoid judgement and bias.  Please listen to others carefully, and thoughtfully consider ideas that are different from your own.  Whatever your goals in life, you will be a better maker, builder, salesperson, colleague, leader, friend, and citizen if you are able to understand and accommodate a diverse range of perspectives!  Also consider that mathematics is a robust and potentially persuasive analytic tool that can be used to challenge inherently inequitable systems of power and privilege. I treat it as such and want you to feel similarly empowered.
      </p>
      <p>
        I expect our classroom to be a true community of learners, and anyone who acts in a negative, threatening, or disruptive way through their words or actions harms that community and inhibits the participation of others. Rude, mocking, obscene, hateful, racist, sexist, and all other forms of disrespectful speech have a negative impact on everyone's learning and will not be tolerated. If a person disrupts our class in any of these ways, I will address it and reserve the right to remove the disruptive person from the class.  Moreover, if you witness a peer behaving in an objectionable way, I invite you to try to help them examine their actions with empathy and care.  We will all make mistakes in the messy and complicated process of working together and must help one another be accountable for reflecting on how our impact may differ from our intent.  When I make such a mistake, I hope you will hold me to the same high ideals and courageously help me examine my own impact.  There will be a feedback form on our Moodle page in case you ever wish to report something to me (anonymously, if you prefer) that you find objectionable along any of the lines described above (e.g., behavior you experience as unwelcoming in any regard).

      <title>Rationale for Standards-Based Grading</title>
      <p>
        While it may seem complicated, there are numerous reasons for adopting this type of grading scheme described above, all of which I firmly believe benefit you.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>It is empowering and confidence-inspiring to know exactly what you have mastered-- and it's a more honest measure of what you've actually learned!  No more random points grab.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It is built on the premise that deep understanding takes time and practice.  Getting multiple chances to learn something favors the kind of persistence and intellectual resilience that is needed to succeed in learning (and everything else), and I want to prioritize that.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It gives you more agency and control over your ultimate grade.  You get to decide whether to revise or challenge a quiz to boost your P/P+ numbers, which topics to revisit, or whether to spend a token on an extension instead. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>It replaces a few, high-stakes assessments (exams) with more numerous, low-stakes assessments, which decreases stress and pressure by spreading measurement out over the semester.  It also makes your grade less susceptible to outlier events, such as when you feel sick on exam day.

    <title>In-Person Learning During COVID-19</title>
    <p>
      To create a successful in-person learning environment while keeping everyone safe, all students and instructors must follow the University’s COVID-19 rules and procedures that are in place at any given time during the semester for classrooms, labs, and all common areas of academic buildings. Such rules and procedures may include required face coverings, suggested distancing protocols and directions, and cleaning one’s desk space after usage, among other things. No food will be allowed in the classrooms or laboratories. Only water will be allowed in the classrooms but is not allowed in laboratories. If the University requires face coverings, they may only be removed temporarily when taking a drink of water. Failure to follow any of the COVID-19 classroom rules could result in a student’s removal from the course and/or a report filed with the Office of Student Conduct.
    </p>

    <p>
      Generally, students are expected to attend all class sessions according to the instructor’s direction. Students who feel unwell or have a temperature above 100 degrees should NOT attend class in person. These students should inform their instructor as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students who must be in quarantine or isolation due to their own symptoms or exposure to someone with COVID-19 should also contact their instructor as soon as possible to work out details for keeping up with the course material remotely while in quarantine or isolation. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note, should the instructor test positive for COVID-19, even without symptoms, the course will be temporarily conducted remotely. Should the instructor be unable to teach for an extended period of time, the respective department or unit will find a substitute to continue the course either in person or online.

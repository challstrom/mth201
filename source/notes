            <li> <title>Drop-In Student Hours</title> 
              <p>I have set aside the following specific times during the week that I am available for drop-in help. You do not need to let me know you're coming -- just stop by my office (BC 270). Many students find these drop-in hours can be particularly helpful if you are working together with classmates. You can work together at one of the tables down the hall from my office and just pop in when you have any questions.

            <li><title>Sign-Up Hours</title> 
              <p>I recognize that your schedule might not allow you to stop by during the posted drop-in hours.  Or you simply might find it more convenient to meet with me at a different time.  If you go to my Calendly scheduler <url href="https://calendly.com/hallstro">calendly.com/hallstro</url>, you can sign-up for a time slot to meet, either in person or via zoom.  If there is a specific time that works for you and you don't see it available on the Calendly scheduler, please reach out to me via email and we will find a time that works for your schedule.

            <li><title>Open Door</title> 
              <p>I have the scheduled drop-in hours simply to give you some times when you know that I'll be available -- but you are <em>always</em> welcome to stop by my office <em>at any time</em>.  Unless I'm in class or in a meeting, I will generally be available to meet with you.

            <li><title>Math Resource Center</title>
              <p>The MRC offers both drop-in tutoring as well as individualized help.  I will post the MRC schedule on Moodle as soon as it becomes available (usually the second week of the semester).  You can also find information about the MRC (and other resources at the Learning Commons) at <url href="https://bit.ly/learning-up">https://bit.ly/learning-up</url>

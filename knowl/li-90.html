</h3>
<div class="para">In short, that any work you represent as your own, is your own. Much of your work can be done in groups, but not all of it. I will assume that you have access to a calculator, including online tools (like <a class="external" href="https://www.symbolab.com/" target="_blank">Symbolab</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-11-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>) that give you step-by-step solutions.</div>
<div class="para">Use of these tools is acceptable, but take care that you are not overly reliant on them. What is not acceptable is having someone else do your work for you. This includes tutors, classmates, friends, family members, and online “homework help” sites. If you are paying money in exchange for answers to graded work, you are committing an academic offence.</div>
<div class="para">Penalties for academic dishonesty are outlined in the <a class="external" href="https://www.uleth.ca/policy/resources/student-discipline-policy-academic-offences-undergraduate-students" target="_blank">Academic Calendar</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-12-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>. Depending on the severity of the offence, penalties for a first offence can range from a grade of zero on an assessment, to an F in the courses. Academic offences are also reported to the Dean of Arts &amp; Sciences. They keep a record of each offence, and students with multiple offences can be subject to supplementary discipline.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-policies.html#li-90" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

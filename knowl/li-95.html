<div class="para">First, make sure that you have registered with the University’s <a class="external" href="https://www.uleth.ca/ross/accommodated-learning-centre" target="_blank">Accommodated Learning Centre</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-13-hidden.html" title="Footnote 7.0.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>.

It’s on the to-do list, but that list is long, and growing.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-policies.html#li-95" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

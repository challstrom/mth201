<div class="para">There are many of us in this class, coming from many different backgrounds and situations. If the “default settings” for the class don’t work for you, please don’t hesitate to ask for accommodation. Not everyone has reliable high speed internet. Not everyone is able to attend scheduled classes without work/family/life getting in the way. But everyone deserves a fulfilling, enjoyable learning experience in each class. (Yes, including calculus. You are here to experience the joy of doing mathematics, no?)</div>

<div class="para">If there are any adjustments I can make to facilitate your learning, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me. All students deserve an equal opportunity to learn. Note that the <abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr> textbook is designed with accessibility in mind, and should work with screen readers. However, I regret that we have not had the time (or paid help) necessary to add elements such as alt-text descriptions for images. Itâ€™s on the to-do list, but that list is long, and growing.</div>

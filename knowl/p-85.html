<div class="para">The following grading notes apply. Each test is worth a total of 13 points.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Prior to each test you will be asked to submit a “study sheet”. This will be worth 2 points.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You will be asked to give (anonymous) feedback on the study sheets of three other students. This will be worth 1 point.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You will write the test <em class="emphasis">individually</em>, and submit via <dfn class="terminology">Crowdmark</dfn>. The individual test will be worth 6 points.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">After the individual test, there will be a follow-up <em class="emphasis">group test</em>. This will take place in class, and will be worth 2 points.</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">After your test has been graded, you will be asked to submit a short reflection piece, where you comment on your performance and the feedback you receive.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Typically, you will be asked to comment on the following:</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">What did you do to prepare for the test?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What types of mistakes did you make on the test?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What (if anything) could you do differently next time?</div></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="para">Post-test reflection will also be worth 2 points.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="para">There are five tests in total. I will automatically take your best 4 out of 5 test scores. That way you can miss a test (or have a bad day) without affecting your grade.</div>
<div class="para">Notice that the individual portion of the test (i.e. “the test”) is only worth just under half the total test grade. So you can tank the test and still pass the test, if that makes sense. (But if you’ve done the pre-test activity I bet you won’t tank it.)</div>
<div class="para">Note that the group test is scheduled to take place in class. I will be working to identify students for whom this would be a hardship. Those of you who legitimately cannot attend (you know, for reasons) will be grouped together and given an alternative activity.</div>

<div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">I don’t think I can attend the classes regularly. Can I still take the course?</span></span><div class="para">Short answer: yes. I recognize that not all students have access to the same technology. If your home internet is unreliable, attending Zoom sessions could be a challenge. If you can’t attend synchronous sessions, I will arrange alternatives for graded work done asynchronously. I will also try to connect you with other students in the same situation, so that you still have a group you can work with.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">What happens if I get sick?</span></span><div class="para">I’ll do my best to be accommodating of any illness that interrupts your studies. There is no need to provide details of the illness. If you miss a week or more of work, please get in touch to make a plan for catching up. One of the biggest challenges in math is that once you fall behind, it’s difficult to catch up on your own.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">What exactly does academic honesty mean?</span></span><div class="para">In short, that any work you represent as your own, is your own. Much of your work can be done in groups, but not all of it. I will assume that you have access to a calculator, including online tools (like <a class="external" href="https://www.symbolab.com/" target="_blank">Symbolab</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-21-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>) that give you step-by-step solutions.</div>
<div class="para">Use of these tools is acceptable, but take care that you are not overly reliant on them. What is not acceptable is having someone else do your work for you. This includes tutors, classmates, friends, family members, and online “homework help” sites. If you are paying money in exchange for answers to graded work, you are committing an academic offence.</div>
<div class="para">Penalties for academic dishonesty are outlined in the <a class="external" href="https://www.uleth.ca/policy/resources/student-discipline-policy-academic-offences-undergraduate-students" target="_blank">Academic Calendar</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-22-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>. Depending on the severity of the offence, penalties for a first offence can range from a grade of zero on an assessment, to an F in the courses. Academic offences are also reported to the Dean of Arts &amp; Sciences. They keep a record of each offence, and students with multiple offences can be subject to supplementary discipline.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Does that mean I’m not allowed to get help with my homework?</span></span><div class="para">Not at all! But keep in mind that your course instructors will be available for help, free of charge. (OK, maybe not free of charge, but you’ve already paid for it with your tuition.) We will be responding on the discussion forum regularly, There will be time to ask questions in every class, and there will be online office hours. The Student Success Centre will also be running free help sessions (details TBA).</div>
<div class="para">Some of you may still decide to pay for tutoring, and that’s fine. But you have a duty to disclose sources of help on an assignment, and the individual tests are still tests, even if you won’t have someone watching over your shoulder.</div>
<div class="para">You should probably avoid the various paid “homework help” websites. Most of these don’t offer help. They offer worked solutions for a price. Getting those solutions won’t help with your understanding. More importantly, the people working for these sites are paid (poorly) per solution, and they often provide incorrect and/or badly written work. (We saw plenty of examples of this last Spring, and yes, all those students now have discipline reports on file.)</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">I missed a test! What do I do? Do I get a zero?</span></span><div class="para">First, contact me as soon as possible for any missed test. There are <em class="emphasis">five</em> tests, and I only count <em class="emphasis">four</em> towards your grade. As long as you only miss one test, there is no penalty. This is true regardless of your reason for missing the test.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">What if I really wanted to write that test?</span></span><div class="para">Inform me of this when you contact me to explain your absence. There’s no guarantee that I can schedule a makeup test, but I’ll try. You’re more likely to get a makeup test if you’ve contacted me in advance.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Do I need a doctor’s note?</span></span><div class="para">No. This wastes health care resources and your time. (That was my answer before the pandemic, and it’s doubly so now.) Just email me to say you were sick. However, if you miss more than one test due to illness, we’ll need to meet to discuss how to adjust your grade.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">I receive learning accommodations. What arrangements can I make?</span></span><div class="para">First, make sure that you have registered with the University’s <a class="external" href="https://www.uleth.ca/ross/accommodated-learning-centre" target="_blank">Accommodated Learning Centre</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-23-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.0.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>. No need to let me know: they notify me of every student with accommodations.</div>
<div class="para">Some accommodations will look a bit different this year, but exam accommodations such as extra time are still possible.</div>
<div class="para">If there are any adjustments I can make to facilitate your learning, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me. All students deserve an equal opportunity to learn. Note that the <abbr class="initialism">HTML</abbr> textbook is designed with accessibility in mind, and should work with screen readers. However, I regret that we have not had the time (or paid help) necessary to add elements such as alt-text descriptions for images. It’s on the to-do list, but that list is long, and growing.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Life intervened and I can’t keep up this week. What do I do?</span></span><div class="para">Send me an email. Extensions are usually granted as long as they’re granted ahead of time. Online homework extensions need to be in place before solutions become available. Book an appointment with me as soon as you feel like you’re falling behind and I’ll do my best to get you up to speed.</div>

<div class="para">Not at all! But keep in mind that your course instructors will be available for help, free of charge. (OK, maybe not free of charge, but you’ve already paid for it with your tuition.) We will be responding on the discussion forum regularly, There will be time to ask questions in every class, and there will be online office hours. The Student Success Centre will also be running free help sessions (details TBA).</div>
<div class="para">Some of you may still decide to pay for tutoring, and that’s fine. But you have a duty to disclose sources of help on an assignment, and the individual tests are still tests, even if you won’t have someone watching over your shoulder.</div>
<div class="para">You should probably avoid the various paid “homework help” websites. Most of these don’t offer help. They offer worked solutions for a price. Getting those solutions won’t help with your understanding. More importantly, the people working for these sites are paid (poorly) per solution, and they often provide incorrect and/or badly written work. (We saw plenty of examples of this last Spring, and yes, all those students now have discipline reports on file.)</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-policies.html#li-76" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

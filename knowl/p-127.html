<div class="para">At the bottom of each page is an “Email Instructor” button. If you are stuck on a problem, or if you think there is an error in the programming (it happens!) you can use this to let me know. WeBWorK will send me an email with your message, along with a link to the exact version of the problem you were working on. Often I can figure out where you’re going wrong by looking at your answer.</div>
<div class="para">Please <em class="emphasis">do not</em> use the email button to ask me how to solve a problem. That’s what the discussion forum is for. It should only be used afer you’ve made several attempts at the problem, or if you see an error message of some sort.</div>

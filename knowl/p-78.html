<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">A: wow, they clearly discussed this as a group, and nailed down all the key points! I also appreciate how the work is legible and relatively free of frustrated scribbling.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">B: everyone had something to say, but I’m not sure they all agreed. There’s an obvious mistake that someone should have caught, suggesting that nobody thought to read it over before submitting.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">C: most of the details are there but this was clearly done in the last hour before the deadline. Also, it looks suspiciously like one person did all the work.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">D: looks like parts (a), (b), (c), and (d) were each done by a different person, and then arranged randomly on the page.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">F: nothing submitted. Or work is a crude drawing of what appears to be an integral attacking a kitten.</div></li>

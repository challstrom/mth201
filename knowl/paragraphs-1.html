<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Group work in Zoom.</span></h4> <div class="para">During most Zoom sessions, you will be put into smaller breakout rooms to work on problems. Breakout rooms are not recorded, and I cannot actively monitor the breakout rooms — these are essentially private working sessions for your group. I <em class="emphasis">do</em> have the ability to join a breakout room temporarily, but will only do so when invited. If you need my help during a breakout session, there is an “Ask for help” button you can use to get my attention.</div> <div class="para">You will be encouraged to use Microsoft OneNote to collaborate with your group. OneNote lets you type notes, insert photos, and use handwriting, if you have a touch-enabled device. Unlike the Zoom chat and whiteboard features, your OneNote notebook will remain available after class for you to refer to.

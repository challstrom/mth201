<div class="para">You should probably avoid the various paid “homework help” websites. Most of these don’t offer help. They offer worked solutions for a price. Getting those solutions won’t help with your understanding. More importantly, the people working for these sites are paid (poorly) per solution, and they often provide incorrect and/or badly written work. (We saw plenty of examples of this last Spring, and yes, all those students now have discipline reports on file.)</div>

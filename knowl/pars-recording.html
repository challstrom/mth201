I will record myself if I’m doing an example or solving a problem someone has requested, and post those recordings online for later reference. I have things set up so that I only record myself, with recording anyone else. This should let us avoid any privacy concerns.</div> <div class="para">Please be aware that it is an <em class="alert">academic offence</em> to record a class, or anyone in it, without prior authorization. If all members of a breakout room agree to having someone record your discussion, this is fine. When are in the “main room” of Zoom, recording is not permitted.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-technology.html#pars-recording" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

<div class="para">Assignments will be done in groups, and there will be time set aside in each class to work on them. Each assignment have only one or two problems, but these will typically involve multiple steps, and you will be graded as much on the quality of your explanation as on the validity of your mathematics.</div>
<div class="para">Typically a written assignment is expected, but interested students are encouraged to explore alternative formats. For example, if a group wants to submit a video presentation instead of written work, that sounds like fun, and I will totally be on board with that.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Here is a fictitious (but possibly informative) grading rubric for assignments:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">A: wow, they clearly discussed this as a group, and nailed down all the key points! I also appreciate how the work is legible and relatively free of frustrated scribbling.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">B: everyone had something to say, but I’m not sure they all agreed. There’s an obvious mistake that someone should have caught, suggesting that nobody thought to read it over before submitting.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">C: most of the details are there but this was clearly done in the last hour before the deadline. Also, it looks suspiciously like one person did all the work.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">D: looks like parts (a), (b), (c), and (d) were each done by a different person, and then arranged randomly on the page.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">F: nothing submitted. Or work is a crude drawing of what appears to be an integral attacking a kitten.</div></li>

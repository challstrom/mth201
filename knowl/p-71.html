<div class="para logical"><dl class="description-list">
<dt>Reading questions (5%)</dt>
<dd><div class="para">To encourage you to keep up to date with the textbook readings/videos, there will be a weekly quiz, delivered via WeBWorK. The quiz questions will check your reading; not your math. Reading questions will be due by 8 am every Wednesday. The main purpose of the questions is for me to be able to identify (from your responses) what areas of the content need to be addressed in class. Typically any reasonable effort to answer will receive full credit.</div></dd>
<dt>Tutorials (10%)</dt>
<dd>
<div class="para">Every tutorial will involve an assignment to be completed. You will be encouraged to work on these problems in groups. Evaluation will be strictly <em class="emphasis">formative</em>: you will receive feedback on the work that you submit, but any sincere demonstration of effort will receive full credit.</div>
<div class="para">In subsequent tutorials I may check to see if you’ve actually read the feedback you receive. Since you’re not being graded on whether you’re right or wrong, we’ll use tutorials as an opportunity for you to learn all the basic computational skills.</div>
</dd>
<dt>Online Homework (10%)</dt>
<dd><div class="para">The homework, like tutorial, will focus on building fluency with the computational procedures of calculus. You can expect a new problem set every week. Homework will be delivered through the <dfn class="terminology">WeBWorK</dfn> online homework system. See <a href="subsec-webwork.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 4.1: Online homework">Subsection 4.1</a> for details.</div></dd>
<dt>Assignments (10%)</dt>
<dd>
<div class="para">Assignments will be done in groups, and there will be time set aside in each class to work on them. Each assignment have only one or two problems, but these will typically involve multiple steps, and you will be graded as much on the quality of your explanation as on the validity of your mathematics.</div>
<div class="para">Typically a written assignment is expected, but interested students are encouraged to explore alternative formats. For example, if a group wants to submit a video presentation instead of written work, that sounds like fun, and I will totally be on board with that.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Here is a fictitious (but possibly informative) grading rubric for assignments:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">A: wow, they clearly discussed this as a group, and nailed down all the key points! I also appreciate how the work is legible and relatively free of frustrated scribbling.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">B: everyone had something to say, but I’m not sure they all agreed. There’s an obvious mistake that someone should have caught, suggesting that nobody thought to read it over before submitting.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">C: most of the details are there but this was clearly done in the last hour before the deadline. Also, it looks suspiciously like one person did all the work.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">D: looks like parts (a), (b), (c), and (d) were each done by a different person, and then arranged randomly on the page.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">F: nothing submitted. Or work is a crude drawing of what appears to be an integral attacking a kitten.</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
</dd>
<dt>Tests (65%)</dt>
<dd>
<div class="para">Each of the five chapters will conclude with a test. The test will be open book. There will be a time limit, but you will have some flexibility in terms of when you choose to begin. Details on test dates can be found in <a href="section-schedule.html" class="internal" title="Section 7: Course schedule">Section 7</a>.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The following grading notes apply. Each test is worth a total of 13 points.</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Prior to each test you will be asked to submit a “study sheet”. This will be worth 2 points.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You will be asked to give (anonymous) feedback on the study sheets of three other students. This will be worth 1 point.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You will write the test <em class="emphasis">individually</em>, and submit via <dfn class="terminology">Crowdmark</dfn>. The individual test will be worth 6 points.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">After the individual test, there will be a follow-up <em class="emphasis">group test</em>. This will take place in class, and will be worth 2 points.</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">After your test has been graded, you will be asked to submit a short reflection piece, where you comment on your performance and the feedback you receive.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Typically, you will be asked to comment on the following:</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">What did you do to prepare for the test?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What types of mistakes did you make on the test?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What (if anything) could you do differently next time?</div></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="para">Post-test reflection will also be worth 2 points.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="para">There are five tests in total. I will automatically take your best 4 out of 5 test scores. That way you can miss a test (or have a bad day) without affecting your grade.</div>
<div class="para">Notice that the individual portion of the test (i.e. “the test”) is only worth just under half the total test grade. So you can tank the test and still pass the test, if that makes sense. (But if you’ve done the pre-test activity I bet you won’t tank it.)</div>
<div class="para">Note that the group test is scheduled to take place in class. I will be working to identify students for whom this would be a hardship. Those of you who legitimately cannot attend (you know, for reasons) will be grouped together and given an alternative activity.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<dt>Participation</dt>
<dd>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Participation credit can be earned as follows:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Contributions to the discussion forum</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Contributions to annotations in the textbook</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Active participation in synchronous meetings</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="para">Participation is not required, and does not directly affect your grade. Quality participation is regular (at least weekly), and enhances the learning experience for your classmates.</div>
<div class="para">For many students, life intervenes and you miss a deadline, forget an assignment, etc. Participation is your way to demonstrate continued engagement in the class, even if you mess up on the occasional assessment.</div>
<div class="para">With that in mind, participation credit is <em class="alert">redeemable</em>. <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-15-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>
</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">You can redeem your quality course participation for: <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-16-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>
</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">A no-questions-asked extension for online homework or an assignment.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A hint during a test.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Forgetting to do your reading questions.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Forgetting to do your post-test reflection. (Depending on how you did on the test. I might decide you really need to do it.)</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="para">Alternatively, you can save up those participation credits for the <dfn class="terminology">big ask</dfn>. Namely, there comes a point at the end of semester where a student looks at their grade, (and possibly <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/table-lettergrade.html" title="Table 2.4.1: Conversion of percentage scores to letter grades in Math 1560">Table 2.4.1</a> below) and sends an email saying something like, “But I’m only 2% away from an A-!” If you’ve been participating regularly throughout the semester, I may be willing to entertain such a request.</div>

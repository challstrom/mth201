<div class="para">There are five tests in total. I will automatically take your best 4 out of 5 test scores. That way you can miss a test (or have a bad day) without affecting your grade.</div>
<div class="para">Notice that the individual portion of the test (i.e. “the test”) is only worth just under half the total test grade. So you can tank the test and still pass the test, if that makes sense. (But if you’ve done the pre-test activity I bet you won’t tank it.)</div>
<div class="para">Note that the group test is scheduled to take place in class. I will be working to identify students for whom this would be a hardship. Those of you who legitimately cannot attend (you know, for reasons) will be grouped together and given an alternative activity.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="subsec-grading.html#li-47" class="internal">in-context</a></span>

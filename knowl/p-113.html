<div class="para">The following communication channels are available in this course:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Forums.</span></span><div class="para">There will be a primary course Q&amp;A forum using <a class="external" href="https://piazza.com" target="_blank">Piazza</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-17-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.0.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. We use Piazza rather than the internal Moodle forums due to a couple of useful features:</div>
<div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Students can choose to remain anonymous (to their peers) when asking a question.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">There is a “live” Q&amp;A feature that we can use during class.</div></li>
</ol></div>
<div class="para">The Piazza forum should be your primary communication channel. In particular, any questions about homework and course content should be asked on Piazza, since I can reply there with mathematical notation. You will also get a much faster reply on the forum than you will from email.</div>
<div class="para">There is one exception: in our WeBWorK online homework system, there is an “Email Instructor” button you can click to send feedback. This is useful if you think there’s an error in the question, or if you’ve tried it several times and can’t figure out why you’re wrong. See <a href="subsec-webwork.html" class="internal" title="Subsection 4.1: Online homework">Subsection 4.1</a> for details.</div>
<div class="para">
<em class="alert">Note:</em> Piazza will be accessible from Moodle as a plugin. In the past we encountered a bug where two students get assiged the same account ID. If you find yourself signed in as someone else, let me know.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Email.</span></span><div class="para">You can email me for questions that aren’t related to course content. For example, if you have to miss class, or a test, you can email me to let me know.</div>
